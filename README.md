# Small Haskell app with HTTP & JSON

Followed along this tutorial by [Morten Kolstad](https://github.com/morteako) to understand a practical context for Haskell language:
https://functional.christmas/2019/23

Learned about the following things:
  Setting up Stack
  Setting up a new project using Stack and a hpack template
  Basic IO, printing, executing Haskell code
  .yaml and dependencies
  Basics of Lens and using packages to send out HTTP requests & do Bytestring conversion
  Setting up ghcid for Rapid development
  Simple error handling

Tip of the iceberg, surely. But, this tutorial really gave me a broader understanding of what is possible with Haskell. More experiments coming up soon.
